JSC
==================
A Bukkit mod that allows you to write plugins in Javascript.

JSC is an enhanced version of Walter Higgins's [ScriptCraft](https://github.com/walterhiggins/ScriptCraft), redone by me.

## What is it?

This is essentially a clean, simplicity-oriented version of ScriptCraft, where the source has pretty much nothing but needed code, and a few handy modules that can be removed on demand.
All documentation can be found in the Wiki page of this project.

## What do I need?

To use this, you need a working [Bukkit](http://bukkit.org) server, running on Java 7.

***Note that as of right now, Java 8 is NOT supported, although it is planned.***

## How do I install this?

Simply download [this file](https://github.com/Strat-/JSC/raw/master/bin/latest/jsc.jar), and place it in your Bukkit server's plugins/ directory.
Once you have done that, either start the server, or if it has already started, run the "reload" command so the server loads the plugin.

## Then what?

Once you have done everything, just go to the plugins/jsc/ directory, and start writing your own Javascript modules/plugins and place them in their respective directories.

## How do I do that?

Read the [wiki](https://github.com/Strat-/JSC/wiki).
